This repository is a revision of Horiseon's website design. The company specializes in marketing agency that specializes in online management and social media marketing. They requested support with making their website accessible to all customers including those with disabilities. I also focused on refracting the index and stylesheet to clean up the code and allow for easier management in the future.
